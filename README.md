# QSS 20 Final Project

**Group Members:** Evan McDermid, Paul Waxman 

## Project Overview

We are analyzing the correlation between Philadelphia crime incidents and Philadelphia Eagles football game results.

The questions we want to answer:

- How do Philadelphia Eagles games impact crime rates before, during, and after games?
- Do domestic abuse reports change around wins and/or losses?
- How do yearly crime rates correlate with the teamâ€™s success?
- Is this impact unique to Philadelphia? How does it compare to:
  - Other sports (e.g., Philadelphia 76ers)
  - Other cities (e.g., Chicago Bears)
- Where in the city does crime occur in relation to game outcomes?
- What types of crimes (e.g., domestic abuse, arson, assault) are most affected?
